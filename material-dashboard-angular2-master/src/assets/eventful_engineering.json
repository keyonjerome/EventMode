                "description": " Course Description: Scrum, Extreme Programming, Lean, Feature Driven Development and other methods each have their strengths. While there are significant similarities under the Agile umbrella, each method brings specific tools for team success. Rarely do organizations adopt one methodology in its pure form. Rather, success is achieved by combining best practices.  In this three-day Agile Boot Camp, you will put the skills, tools and techniques you are taught to work. The classroom will be broken up into Agile teams and an expert instructor will drive each team through the Agile process: from vision down to daily planning and execution. Your instructor will answer questions with real-world experience, as all of our instructors have Agile experience “in the trenches.” You will leave the class with practical knowledge and a clear roadmap for success.  Course Topics: DAY 1  1. Agile Introduction & Overview 2. Forming the Agile Team 3. Product Vision 4. Focus on the Customer 5. Creating a Product Backlog 6. Product Roadmap  DAY 2  1. Prioritizing the Product Backlog 2. Estimating 3. Release Planning 4. Story Review DAY 3  1. Iteration Execution 2. Measuring & Communicating Progress 3. Iteration Review & Demo 4. Retrospectives Course Outline:  Agile Introduction and Overview ●     Why Agile ●     Agile Methods ●     Agile Benefits ●     Agile Basics – understanding the lingo Forming the Agile Team ●     Team Roles ●     Process Expectations ●     Self organizing teams – where flexibility exists ●     Communication – inside and out Product Vision ●     Five Levels of Planning in Agile      – Vision      – Roadmap      – Release      – Iteration      – Daily ●     Importance of Product Vision ●     Creating and communicating vision Focus on the Customer ●     User Roles ●     Customer Personas ●     Customer Participation Creating a Product Backlog ●     User Stories ●     Acceptance Tests ●     What makes a good story (sizing and substance) ●     Story Writing Workshop Product Roadmap ●     Product Themes ●     Importance of Focus ●     Creating the Roadmap ●     Communication ●     Maintaining the Roadmap Prioritizing the Product Backlog ●     Methods for prioritizing ●     Building Trust ●     Expectations for prioritizing stories Estimating ●     Actual vs Relative estimating ●     Story Points ●     Planning Poker ●     Estimating Team velocity Release Planning ●     Utilizing velocity ●     Continuous Integration ●     Regular cadence Story Review ●     Getting to the details ●     Methods ●     Keeping cadence Iteration Planning ●     Task breakdown ●     Time estimates ●     Definition of “done” ●     Active participation Iteration Execution ●     Collaboration – value individuals and interactions      – Communication      – Daily Standup (Scrum)      – Taskboards ●     Cadence Measuring and Communicating Progress ●     Actual effort and remaining effort ●     Burndown charts ●     Tools and Reporting ●     Your company specific measures Iteration Review and Demo ●     Iteration Review ●     Demos – a change from the past Retrospectives ●     What we did well ●     What did not go so well ●     What will we improve Bringing it All Together ●     Process Overview ●     Transparency ●     Cadence ●     Team Roadmap Course Features: Learning Objectives:  ● Structure a team with generalizing specialists so the team can develop working software incrementally. ● Practice and maintain a regular cadence when delivering working software each iteration. ● Follow the team approach; start as a team, finish as a team — and focus on delivering value to the organization. ● Gain knowledge and understanding of Agile principles and why they are so important for each team. ● Embrace the five levels of planning and recognize the value of continuous planning. ● Build a backlog of prioritized and estimated user stories that provides emergent requirements for analysis and foster customer engagement and understanding. ● Engage in more effective estimating (story points) and become more accurate by being less precise. ● Create accurate Agile release plans that connect you back to business expectations – including hard date commitments and fixed price models. Certification: Once after the training you receive course completion certificate from Mangates Who can Attend? Because this is an immersion course and the intent is to engage in the practices every Agile team will employ, this course is recommended for all team members responsible for delivering outstanding software. That includes, but is not limited to, the following roles:  ●     Business Analyst ●     Technical Analyst ●     Project Manager ●     Software Engineer/Programmer ●     Development Manager ●     Product Manager ●     Product Analyst ●     Tester ●     QA Engineer ●     Documentation Specialist   ",

For any questions, please contact odscience@carleton.ca.<p>Event Program<p>The Life Sciences Day 4.0: The Ottawa Opportunity program will include a keynote presentation, exciting panel discussions, and innovative research presentations by Carleton faculty members and individuals from the external research community. This year’s program will focus on the following themes:<p>Cannabis Research<br> Devices and Diagnostics<br> Agriculture and Food<p>During the event, attendees will have the opportunity to visit several exhibitor booths in the Richcraft Atrium. Last year, exhibitors included Carleton’s Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering and Design, MacOdrum Library, Department of Psychology, Department of History, READi, and Industry and Partnership Services, as well as IEEE, Mitacs, and the Society for Neuroscience – Ottawa Chapter.<p>The event will also include a poster competition, for which over 30 students will be selected and provided with an opportunity to present their research. Throughout the day, student posters will be showcased, with cash prizes being awarded to all three groups (undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral) as judged by an external committee.<p>Parallel presentations by Carleton researchers will underscore the variety of Life Sciences research ongoing at Carleton across all faculties including the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Engineering and Design, the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and the Faculty of Public Affairs. Following a networking lunch and poster viewing, an exploration of industry needs and partnership potential will be explored by a panel discussion of members of the Life Sciences industry in Ontario.<p>A mid-afternoon reception will allow networking time to further investigate areas of potential interest among attendees. Business and industry participants will also have the opportunity to meet with students through a facilitated networking program. Industry, life science organizations and government agencies will be invited to participate.<p>Join the conversation using #LifeSci4 on social media!</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",
